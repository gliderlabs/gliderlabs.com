        <p>Glider Labs was founded in Austin, Texas in 2014 by Andy Shinn and Jeff Lindsay.</p>
        <p>At the time, Andy was working with a startup in San Francisco as a remote devops engineer. He had been working with servers in the datacenter since a teenager, building and running several hosting companies and ISPs. Andy has always been a system operator at heart.</p>
        <p>Jeff, on the other hand, has always been a toolmaker. Starting as a web developer, he slowly went down the systems programming rabbit hole. It began at NASA Ames, where he worked on NASA Nebula, which became OpenStack. Later, after leaving Twilio, he worked with dotCloud to conceptualize and prototype Docker.</p>
        <p>The two, who had known each other for over 10 years, decided to move from the bay area to Austin in early 2014. As musicians, they were expecting to start a band, not start a company together.</p>
        <p>Excited by the future of cloud infrastructure and system automation, Andy found himself playing with Docker. He would talk to his colleague Jeff about the challenges of actually using Docker and related tools for real world applications.</p>
        <p>Eventually they started applying their knowledge and tools to contract clients that sort of just fell into their lap. By the end of 2014, they were overbooked and hadn't even put up a website. Then one weekend in January of 2015, they made this website.</p>
