        <p>Glider Labs creates and maintains innovative open source systems software.</p>

<p>Because we are not a VC funded company, Glider Labs can take the time to focus on simple and composable tools for building systems.</p>

<p>Support our on-going work with a monthly contribution of $100.</p>

<p>Your contribution establishes a formal relationship with us as one of our most supportive users. It tells us we can come to you first for feedback and announcements.</p>

<p>You probably realize that $100 is less than our hourly rate, however, it serves an important function. It tells us we're on the right path. It shows us the value and impact of our work. It's an on-going vote of confidence.</p>

<p>If you or your organization uses our tools, please consider showing your support and joining our patron program.</p>
