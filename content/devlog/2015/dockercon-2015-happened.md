This year we attended the second annual DockerCon in San Francisco. We almost didn't, as our proposed talks were passed on. My abstracts are often generic sounding placeholders, so I don't blame the conference organizers for skipping over an original Docker team member. Regardless, a month before the event, I got an invitation to moderate lightning talks, as well as to give one.

Separately, our work with Docker, ClusterHQ, and Weaveworks on Docker plugins was announced at the keynote. They gave the three of us a session to introduce Docker plugins in more detail. ClusterHQ has [a nice write-up](https://clusterhq.com/2015/07/01/docker-plugins-complete-the-puzzle/), though The New Stack also has [a good write-up](http://thenewstack.io/the-real-docker-ecosystem-launches-with-plugins/) as industry press. I was just pleasantly surprised to see the Glider Labs logo in Solomon's keynote. (However, I'm not sure why Mesosphere is mentioned at all.)

Besides that it was really great to hear from so many people using Glider Labs projects. Our Alpine image is definitely a hit. We saw a number of Docker employees using it in their demos. Talking to vendors at the booths, it seemed 90% of them were using a Glider Labs project of some kind, whether Alpine, Registrator, or Logspout. This is especially exciting because these projects are just the beginning.

The lightning talks were also fun. I used my lightning talk as an excuse to put together a proof of concept for a project now called Envy. It's a sort of development environment manager, re-envisioning the idea of development environments with containers. I believe somebody suggested it could be a Vagrant killer? I gave the demo several times at DockerCon and it was quite well received.

Definitely looking forward to next year!
