Today we're happy to introduce [Weaveworks](http://weave.works/), authors of [Weave](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave), as our newest sponsor. This sponsorship will most immediately support development and increased releases of [Registrator](https://github.com/gliderlabs/registrator), our Docker service discovery bridge. It also enables us to release a few new projects in this space over the next couple months.

<!--more-->

This six month sponsorship not only supports our work, but the joint effort across vendors to help Docker become more extensible. Along with Weaveworks, we're among a few working with Docker to help design a plugin system, initially allowing basic extension points around networking and volumes.

It also means we'll be exploring integration with various Weave components, such as Registrator with [WeaveDNS](https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/tree/master/weavedns). We'll also be sharing some of the use cases with current and future Weave services for Docker software networking.

Besides our consulting and system integration services, Glider Labs is an independent systems R&D lab. Our open source work towards unraveling the [modern systems mess](http://gliderlabs.com/blog/2015/03/24/the-modern-systems-software-mess/) is made possible by sponsorships like this. If your organization is interested in supporting our work the way Weaveworks has, please [let us know](mailto:team+sponsor@gliderlabs.com).
